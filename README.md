# Tower Attack

## Game
**Tower Attack** is a 3D game made with Unreal where the goal is to **escape from a volcano** that is about to erupt.  
To complete the game, you'll need to **reach the top of the volcano** using a **combination of your characters' spells**.

When you destroy the shield towers shortly after entering the volcano, the lava will start to rise.   
From there, it's up to you to use the different characters to reach the top.

Be careful though, as there will be towers and enemies along the way ready for battle!
